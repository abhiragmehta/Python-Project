Employees Absenteeism Project
Problem Statement:The business environment of today is more competitive than it used to be.This leads to increased work pressure in the work place.Therefore,it is reasonable to expect the unachievable business goals and an elevated risk of unemployment can raise people stress levels.Often the continuous presence of such factors becomes detrimental to a person's health.Sometimes this may result in minor illness,which of course is not desired.However, it may happen that the employee develops a long term condition.An example being depression.So we will predict absenteeism from work.More precisely,we would like to know whether or not an employee can be expected to be missing for a specific numbers of hours in a given workday.Having such information in advance can improve our decision making.How? By reorganising the work the work process in a way that alllow us to avoid a lack of productivity and increase the quality of work generated in our firm.
